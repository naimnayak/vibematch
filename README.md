Reliable Backend with Firebase: Using Firebase allowed me to implement secure authentication and efficient, real-time data handling, so users can focus on their conversations without interruptions.
User-Focused Design: Developed with usability in mind, VibeMatch combines a clean UI with responsiveness to create an enjoyable experience for every user.
